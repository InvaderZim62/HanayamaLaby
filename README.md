# Hanayama Laby

This is a knock-off of a two-sided puzzle made of metal from Labyrinth Games & Puzzles.  The original puzzle
requires you to separate two rings.  One ring contains a two sides puzzle, and the other ring has pegs that
slide through each side of the puzzle at the same time.  I've simulated it here by unfolding the puzzle and
using two bars that move together.  The black parts of the bars cannot pass though the walls of the puzzle.

Use two fingers to pan and rotate the bar.
